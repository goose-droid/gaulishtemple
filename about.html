          <h2>SlÃ¢ne etic subuta!</h2>

          
          <p>I decided to complete this little project as part of the curriculum for <a href="https://toutagalation.org/">ToutÃ¢ Galation</a>, which is an umbrella organization for modern Gaulish Polytheism. That said, I've had the idea for this website for a while now. With this site I'm hoping to create an easy way to write down prayers that aren't meant to be saved and reused, and a way to offer digital offerings, for myself and for anyone else who might find such a thing useful.</p>
          
          <h4>Ephemeral Written Prayer</h4>
          
          <p>As a polytheist, I'm often saying small prayers of praise or petition to the gods. However, I prefer writing them since I find it easier to formulate my words when I am putting those words to paper. Because of that, Iâ€™m often writing prayers out on notebook pages, typing them into the margins of school papers on LibreOffice, and scribbling them down on the back of receipts from the grocery store. These prayers are still not meant to last beyond the immediate moment. The notebook pages get forgotten, the margin-prayers in my essay get deleted before I turn the paper in, and the receipts get tossed in the recycling. In these cases, the action of writing is more important than the result.</p>
          
          <p>This site is meant as a place to write down these prayers, when a pencil and notebook may not be as practical as a phone that can be held in one hand, and when you want to pray in a space slightly nicer than the margins of a math notebook, or in a Notepad window. I've already used the site many times for this sort of thing, while Iâ€™ve been developing it. Iâ€™ve found it useful for myself, and I hope you might find it helpful too.</p>
          
          <h4>Digital Offerings</h4>
          
          <p>Before romanization, the Gauls rarely wrote. And no evidence, historical or archaeological, can tell us the specific words they spoke aloud in prayer. One thing that archaeology has provided us in plenty, however, is the remains of the various non-food offerings the ancient Celts made to the gods.</p>
          
          <p>Archaeologists have found weapons buried in the ground or deposited into bodies of water such as lakes and rivers. Some of these weapons were offered broken or bent, thereby symbolically ending their "life" and devoting them to the gods instead of to human use. Later on, we find the dedication and deposit of various non-weapon votive offerings, including money, pottery, and statuettes more common. Of the latter, there are many models of human body parts, likely offered in hopes of healing an injury or sickness (See: <em>The Celts</em>, ed. by Venceslas Kruta et al., and <em>Les Religions Gauloises</em>, by Jean-Louis Brunaux).</p>
          
          <p>Today, we can offer not only these physical items, but ones made of 1s and 0s, like digital art. But what is the digital equivalent of placing an object on an altar? There are many possible answers to this. Many people have created their own, unique digital altars, and many others may not even feel the need for a digital altar space. Iâ€™ve found a solution that works for me, which is the simple file attachment on the home page. Choosing a file then clearing it alongside a short prayer is a short ritualistic action that makes the dedication of some bit of digital creation feel complete.</p>
          
          <h4>Future Plans for the Site</h4>
          
          <p>In the future, I hope to implement:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>A candle that can be "lit" and "put out"</li>
          <li>More background images</li>
          <li>More thorough background information about offerings and prayer within Gaulish, general Celtic, and general Polytheist contexts, both ancient and modern.</li>
          <li>Continual small improvements as I improve my html, css, and javascript skills</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>In addition to the above, someday I may try to implement a secondary page where visitors can submit prayers to keep and display for others, creating a sort of online prayer book.</p>
          
          <h4>About the Code</h4>
          
          <p>I'm a newbie web programmer, with some limited previous experience in html and css, and no previous experience with javascript. This is likely obvious from the code. If you'd like to stare at it in abject horror, <a href="https://github.com/goose-droid/gaulishtemple">here's the GitHub page</a>.  A lot of the code was pieced together from various html, css, and javascript guides and tutorials across the web. If you find a bug or have any suggestions, feel free to contact me.</p>
          
          <h4>Contact</h4>
          
          <p>I'm on the ToutÃ¢ Galation discord server, Gaulchat, @ollieðŸ¦‰ #8954. You can message me on there, or via the GitHub, linked above.</p>
